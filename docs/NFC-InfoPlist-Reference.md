# NFC Info.plist Reference

This page documents the FeliCa system codes and ISO 7816 AIDs commonly added to iOS NFC apps.

These values belong in the **host app's** `Info.plist`, not in the Swift package itself. In this repository, the example app plist lives at `Example/CENFC/Resources/Info.plist`.

For iOS NFC apps you typically need:

- `NFCReaderUsageDescription` in `Info.plist`
- `com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.felica.systemcodes` in `Info.plist` when scanning FeliCa system codes
- `com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.iso7816.select-identifiers` in `Info.plist` when selecting ISO 7816 applications by AID
- `NFC Tag Reading` capability enabled in Xcode

> Apple will let you ship a broad list, but it is usually better to keep only the values your app actually uses.

## Broad Compatibility Example

These are the merged values collected from public iOS NFC apps and SDKs on GitHub, plus a few already present in local notes.

## Public GitHub Sources

These repositories were used to verify real-world iOS NFC plist values:

- `https://github.com/revtel/react-native-nfc-manager`
- `https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-ios`
- `https://github.com/Gimly-Blockchain/tangem-sdk-ios`
- `https://github.com/idnow/de.idnow.ios.sdk.spm`
- `https://github.com/onfido/onfido-ios-sdk`
- `https://github.com/batuhanoztrk/react-native-nfc-passport-reader`

## Apple Platform Notes

- Apple documents that `NFCTagReaderSession` / `NFCISO7816Tag` will issue `SELECT` for each AID in `com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.iso7816.select-identifiers` and expose the first successful one through `initialSelectedAID`.
- Apple also documents that including `D2760000850101` causes matching DESFire Type 4 tags to be surfaced as `NFCISO7816Tag` instead of `NFCMiFareTag`.
- Apple documents that payment-tag support uses `NFCPaymentTagReaderSession`, and that API is only available in the EU.

## Handling Guidance

- `A0000002471001` and `D2760000850101` map cleanly to concrete library workflows today (`ePassport` and `Type 4 NDEF`).
- `315041592E5359532E4444463031`, `A00000000386980701`, and `F049442E43484E` are useful to include in `Info.plist` so the system can surface `initialSelectedAID`, but they should remain generic ISO 7816 cards unless your app implements issuer-specific APDU flows.
- `D392F000260100000001`, `D3921000310001010408`, `D3921000310001010100`, and `D3921000310001010401` are required for My Number card workflows on iOS; including all four mirrors working production reader configurations.
- For official My Number card APDU/payload layout details (`EF 0006` / `EF 0001`), see `docs/MyNumber-Card-Data-Format.md`.
- The example app now surfaces these AIDs as “Known ISO 7816 Application” hints in the scan detail UI, while keeping unsupported payment / document cards on the safe generic path.

## Recommended Usage

- If your app only reads passports, start with `A0000002471001` and any additional document AIDs you specifically encounter.
- If your app only reads FIDO keys, keep the YubiKey / FIDO entries instead of the full list.
- If your app reads Japanese transit cards, keep the relevant FeliCa system codes instead of the full list.
- Save the final chosen values in the app target's `Info.plist`; for this repo's example app, that is `Example/CENFC/Resources/Info.plist`.
