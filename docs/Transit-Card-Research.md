Y Mobile was inspected through the local IDA MCP instance:

| Raw offset instruction  | `0x24A9C0` | `SUB X1, X0, #0x15E`, where `0x15E` is decimal `350`.                    |

Y Mobile's Dart AOT code gives the strongest live-read evidence for the current Octopus path. The loaded `Runner` binary is the Flutter shell, while `App.framework/App` contains the Dart AOT snapshot with the Octopus reader strings and balance arithmetic. The balance function at `0x24A910` calls the response parser, subtracts `350`, converts to double, divides by `10`, and stores the resulting HKD value.

The `500` constant appears elsewhere in the Dart AOT image, including Flutter/runtime-style code and generated object-pool setup. The Octopus balance call chain found from `OctopusReader.dart`, `060080080117`, and the balance formula uses `350`.

## Implemented Fixes

### Japan IC, ICOCA, Nimoca

CardBal confirms the standard Japan Transit IC balance path:

- FeliCa system code: `0003`
- Balance service: `008B`, encoded for CoreNFC as `8B 00`
- Balance bytes: block bytes 11-12
- Endianness: little-endian
- Unit: JPY

CoreExtendedNFC now reads the balance at offset `0x0B`, matching CardBal. The history read limit is also increased to 20 blocks. Extra logs now include system code, service request versions, raw balance block, raw history blocks, and parsed balance.

### Hong Kong Octopus

CardBal, Metrodroid, FareBot, and TRETJapanNFCReader agree on the card path:

- FeliCa system code: `8008`
- Balance service: `0117`, encoded for CoreNFC as `17 01`
- Balance block: block 0
- Raw value: first four bytes, big-endian
- Live-read raw offset: `350`
- Formula in HKD cents: `(raw - offset) * 10`

Octopus' official FAQ states the HK$50 convenience limit applies to On-Loan Octopus cards issued on or after 2017-10-01 and mobile Octopus products. CardBal and Y Mobile both still use raw offset `350` for service `0117` live balance arithmetic. Metrodroid and FareBot use scan time as a `350`/`500` proxy, which is useful for synthetic tests and weaker for live physical-card reads.

CoreExtendedNFC adds `OctopusReader`, dispatches FeliCa system code `8008` to that reader, formats HKD balances, and logs raw block details. The unified `TransitBalance.balanceRaw` value stores cents. The reader uses offset `350`, matching CardBal, Y Mobile, and the physical-card scan where raw `920` displays HK$57.00.

Octopus offset decision:

- Live service `0117` balance reads use offset `350`.
- Raw `920` yields `(920 - 350) * 10 = 5700` HKD cents, displayed as HK$57.00.
- Applying offset `500` to the same raw value displays HK$42.00, which is HK$15.00 below the observed card balance.
- CoreExtendedNFC keeps a single live-read offset constant until a reliable card-side signal identifies a different raw-value encoding.

### China T-Union, Shenzhen Tong, Nanjing

CardBal confirms the T-Union balance flow:

- AID: `A000000632010105`
- Primary purse APDU: `80 5C 00 02`, `Le=04`
- Negative purse APDU: `80 5C 01 02`, `Le=04`
- Balance bytes: low 31 bits of the big-endian 4-byte response
- Final balance: primary purse minus negative purse
- Unit: CNY fen

Shanghai Public Transportation Card official app IDA findings:

- Binary: `/Users/qaq/Desktop/Payload/上海交通卡.app/上海交通卡`, SHA-256 `67cd64bbc104382c727c086de4c567a7fc39ad8a4291e8e49ce3fced9a211c6f`
- `JYNFCManager` drives ISO 7816 NFC reads through `NFCISO7816APDU(initWithData:)` and `sendCommandAPDU:completionHandler:`.
- `sub_1008DDE0C` sends `00A4040008A000000632010105`, selecting the T-Union AID.
- `sub_1008DE030` and related card-info paths send `00B0950000`, a READ BINARY command for SFI `0x15`.
- `sub_1008DED78` parses one balance response by taking `data[0..<4]` as the primary value and `data[6..<9]` as the negative value, converting both from hex-coded decimal text, then storing `primary - negative` through `setBalance:`.

Metrodroid documents the top bit as a spare/garbage bit, so CoreExtendedNFC masks with `0x7FFFFFFF` before displaying the value. CoreExtendedNFC reads both purse slots and logs SELECT, each purse APDU response, and the final parsed value. A confirmed Shanghai Public Transportation Card returned `00000320` from both purse slots and has a displayed balance of CNY 0.00, which validates the purse-delta formula. For file `0x15` metadata, CoreExtendedNFC first tries `SELECT 0015` plus READ BINARY and then falls back to the official app's `00B0950000` SFI direct-read path when the explicit file SELECT fails. Existing Shenzhen and Nanjing T-Union cards should follow this same AID path when the card exposes the national transport application.

The T-Union AID `A000000632010105` is required in the sample app polling identifiers for CoreNFC ISO 7816 APDU access. The older Shenzhen Tong AID `5041592E535A54` is also present for discovery and logging. Confirmed balance support uses the T-Union AID path above.

### Snapper / KSX6924

CardBal includes the KSX6924-family AID set:

- Hyundai: `A0000004520001`
- T-Money: `D4100000030001`
- Cashbee: `D4100000140001`
- EB Card: `D410000029000001`
- Snapper / MOIBA: `D4100000300001`
- K-Cash: `D4106509900020`

CoreExtendedNFC now tries these AIDs in that order and logs SELECT outcomes, balance APDU responses, and record reads. The sample app `Info.plist` mirrors these AIDs so CoreNFC can surface and transceive with those ISO 7816 applications. The balance APDU remains the KSX6924 command `90 4C 00 00`, `Le=04`.

`KSX6924Reader` continues AID probing when a selectable application reports a recoverable SELECT status through either a response status word or an `unexpectedStatusWord` transport error.

### Taiwan EasyCard

Metrodroid exposes the old EasyCard Classic dump layout:

- Card family: MIFARE Classic, keys required
- Magic: sector 0 block 1 equals `0e140001070208030904081000000000`
- Balance: sector 2 block 0, offset 0, 4-byte little-endian TWD amount
- Refill: sector 2 block 2
- Transactions: sector 3 blocks 1-2, sector 4 blocks 0-2, sector 5 blocks 0-2
- Time: Taipei timezone, seconds since Unix epoch

CoreExtendedNFC formats `TWD` balances as `NT$` integer amounts, ready for a Classic dump parser that consumes already-decrypted dump data.

## Validation Notes

`swift test` is a macOS package invocation and fails because the macOS toolchain lacks CoreNFC. The project is iOS-only, so the validation target is:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Example/CENFC.xcodeproj -scheme CENFC -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build
```

The iOS simulator build passed after these changes.

For the user's physical cards, the best next capture is one scan per card with NFC logging enabled. The key log fields are:

- FeliCa: system code, service versions, raw balance block, raw history blocks.
- ISO 7816: selected AID, APDU command path, status words, raw balance bytes.
- DESFire: selected applications and file metadata where available.
